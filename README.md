# Meet the Technicians
Wordpress plugin that makes a page with a grid of all our team members.  All the data is conveniently stored in a sql database.  Eventually will include a widget that displays a random member.
Includes an beautiful, responsive, easy-to use backend.

## Dear other FRC teams,
I think you'll find this plugin to be very useful to you, if your website runs wordpress.  I've put a lot of work into making it adaptable to any team who needs it; so I feel bad .  If you'd like to use it, just go to releases, download a zip of the latest release, and upload it to the wordpress plugins page.  Feel free to fork it, too.  I've done my best to keep it well documented.
Of course, I'd be really happy to help you.  Email me at llevieux@hightechhigh.org, and I'll do the best I can to make your website perfect.  My hope is that this is easy to use even to people without programming experience.
Robot onwards,
Lucas LeVieux
