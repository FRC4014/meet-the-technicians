## Hey other FRC teams!
I think you'll find this plugin to be very useful if your website runs wordpress. I've put a effort into making it adaptable to any team who needs it. If you'd like to use it, just go to releases, download a zip of the latest release, and upload it to the wordpress plugins page. Feel free to fork it, too. I've done my best to keep it well documented.
